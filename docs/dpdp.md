# DPDP — implemented product logic

> Living source of truth for **DPDP-related code** in this repo.  
> Plan / PDF (stages, legal caveats): [dpdp-implementation-plan.html](./dpdp-implementation-plan.html) · [dpdp-implementation-plan.pdf](./dpdp-implementation-plan.pdf)

**Maintenance:** Any change to DPDP behaviour (notice, consent, age 18, AI strip, audit, retention, grievance, under-18 copy) **must** update this file. Cursor rule: `.cursor/rules/dpdp-docs.mdc`.

This is **not** a legal opinion and **not** a DPDP compliance certificate. After Stages 1–3 the *code* can be as aligned as this product can get. Do not say “we comply with DPDP” until Stage 4 (contracts, named officer, real inbox, breach process).

---

## 1. Status

| Stage | What it is | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 0 | Four locked notice lines | Locked (Sep 2026) |
| 1 | Notice, consent, age 18, safer AI, first audit | **In code** |
| 2 | Export, delete, nominee, complaint form, full audit UI | **In code** |
| 3 | Private KYC storage, 12-month draft purge job | **In code** |
| 4 | Legal name on paper, real grievance inbox, vendor contracts, breach playbook | Org work |

---

## 2. Locked Stage 0 (notice text)

Keep `PRIVACY_NOTICE_VERSION` in sync on **both** sides when the notice text changes.

| Decision | Value |
|----------|--------|
| Data Fiduciary (product name) | MSME One Department |
| Grievance email | `privacy.grievance@msmeone.gov.in` (**mock** until Stage 4) |
| Unused draft life | **12 months after last edit** (policy; not a statutory clock). **15 days before delete**: in-app notification + SMS (mocked until Twilio). Do not delete the whole account because one draft is old. Audit logs stay ≥ 12 months. |
| AI | Optional. KYC never in the model. If AI is off, say so: Fill with AI, model quality score, chat help will not run; type / save / download still work. |

Constants:

- Server: `server/src/lib/privacyNotice.ts`
- Client: `client/src/lib/privacy/constants.ts`

Current notice version: **`2026-09-3`**. Bump this string when the privacy page content changes so old users re-consent.

---

## 3. Stage 1 — what the code does

### 3.1 Notice page

- Public route: `/privacy`
- English / Telugu (follows UI language toggle)
- Linked from Register, Login, Layout footer, Landing footer
- **On Register and the re-consent popup the full notice is inside a scroll box.** The account-consent tick stays **disabled** until the user scrolls to the last line. Switching language resets the scroll and unchecks the box. Opening `/privacy` in a new tab does not skip this.

### 3.2 Consent on the user

Stored on `User.privacy`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `accountConsent` | Required to register / to pass the re-consent popup. **Cannot be ticked until the notice is scrolled to the end** (client). Server still requires `true`. |
| `aiAssist` | Optional. Server refuses AI routes if false |
| `analytics` | Optional; stored only |
| `noticeVersion` / `noticeAcceptedAt` | Which notice they agreed to |
| `dateOfBirth` | Register only; used to block under 18 |

JWT / profile payload includes `privacy.needsNoticeAcceptance` when `noticeVersion !== 2026-09-3`.

**APIs**

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Requires `dateOfBirth`, `accountConsent: true`, optional `aiAssist` / `analytics` / `noticeVersion` |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Returns privacy flags |
| POST | `/api/auth/consent` | Auth required. Re-consent / change AI flag |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Auth required. Audit only |
| GET | `/api/auth/profile` | Public user + privacy (no password) |

Old users: blocking modal (`ConsentGate` on every `ProtectedRoute`) until they accept. Logout is the only way out without accepting.

### 3.3 Under 18

DPDP: under 18 cannot give adult consent. Product rule: the **named entrepreneur / applicant** must be 18+. No child-as-borrower DPR.

| Surface | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| Register | DOB → age &lt; 18 → **no account**. Guardian banner under DOB. Clicking Register **scrolls to that banner**. Code `UNDER_18`. |
| Latest DPR extras | `entrepreneurAge` / `promoterAge` / `applicantAge` / `age` &lt; 18 → no save, no generate, no Fill-all-AI. Banner. |
| Server draft / generate | Same payload check on `/api/dpr/cluster/draft/save` and `/api/dpr/cluster/generate` |
| Scheme Finder | Age question and results show guardian copy. Create-DPR buttons hidden if `age === under18`. Loan schemes already fail the 18+ test. |

Copy lives in i18n `privacy.guardianMessage` (EN/TE) and server `GUARDIAN_MESSAGE`.

### 3.4 Safer AI

1. **Consent gate:** `requireAiConsent` on all `/api/ai/*` and AI DPR routes (suggestions, fill, generate, quality, translate, chat, RAG search, image gen, etc.). Draft save and PDF/DOCX download stay ungated.
2. **Strip KYC:** every `openai.chat.completions.create` goes through `server/src/lib/openaiClient.ts` → `sanitizeForAi` (drops Aadhaar/PAN/passbook/UPI/file URL keys; redacts Aadhaar/PAN patterns and Cloudinary/upload URLs in strings).
3. **UI:** Fill-all and per-step AI suggestions disabled + warning when `aiAssist` is false. 403 body uses `AI_CONSENT_REQUIRED`.

Generate that still calls OpenAI (including Latest DPR `generateClusterDPR`) **requires AI consent**. Preview of the live form does not.

### 3.5 First audit (append-only)

Collection: `auditevents` (`AuditEvent` model). Nobody updates old rows.

Stage 1 actions: `register`, `login_success`, `login_failed`, `logout`, `consent_given`, `consent_withdrawn`, `notice_accepted`, `ai_call`.

Each row: time, userId (if known), role, action, optional targetType/targetId, IP. **Not** Aadhaar, **not** DPR text.

Stage 2 adds DPR/KYC/export/delete/admin screens (see §4.6).

### 3.6 JWT

`getJwtSecret()` (`server/src/lib/jwtSecret.ts`). Production (`NODE_ENV=production`) **exits** if `JWT_SECRET` is missing or is a known dummy (`your-secret-key`, etc.). Dev may warn and use a local dummy.

---

## 4. Stage 2 — what the code does

Page: **`/account/privacy`** (navbar Privacy, Profile → Open privacy settings). Admin audit: **Admin → Audit log**.

### 4.1 Export (access)

`GET /api/privacy/export` (auth). JSON download: profile (no password), projects, DPR versions, sessions, own documents metadata, own complaints. Logs `data_export`.

### 4.2 Turn AI off / correction

`PATCH /api/privacy/consent` `{ aiAssist, analytics }`. Account consent stays required. AI off logs `consent_withdrawn`; AI on logs `consent_given`. Existing `POST /api/auth/consent` still used by the re-consent popup.

Profile edits (`PUT /api/auth/profile`) log `profile_change`.

### 4.3 Nominee

Stored on `User.privacy.nominee` `{ name, phone, email }`. Name plus at least phone or email. `PUT /api/privacy/nominee`. Logs `nominee_change`.

### 4.4 Erasure (complete delete)

`DELETE /api/privacy/account` body `{ confirm: "DELETE" }`. Admin `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` uses the **same** `eraseAccount()` (`server/src/services/accountErase.service.ts`).

Cascade: Cloudinary public ids / upload URLs in projects and DPRs, local `/uploads/` files, OpenAI `file-*` ids, cluster sections, feedback, scheme matches, analytics, sessions, non-template documents, DPR versions, projects, then the user row.

**Audit rows stay.** Processor delete failures are warnings; Mongo data is still removed.

### 4.5 Grievance

`POST /api/privacy/complaint` `{ subject, message }`. Saves `PrivacyComplaint` (inbox `privacy.grievance@msmeone.gov.in`). No SMTP yet — server log line only. Logs `complaint_submitted`. A human must still reply (~90 days for rights requests).

### 4.6 Full audit

Append-only `auditevents`. Stage 2 actions (in addition to Stage 1): `dpr_create`, `dpr_change`, `dpr_download`, `dpr_delete`, `kyc_upload`, `kyc_delete`, `data_export`, `account_delete`, `admin_view`, `profile_change`, `nominee_change`, `complaint_submitted`.

- **User:** `GET /api/privacy/activity` — own logins, downloads, exports, consent, etc. No other people’s rows.
- **User inbox:** `GET /api/privacy/notifications`, `POST /api/privacy/notifications/:id/read` (`id` can be `all`).
- **Admin:** `GET /api/admin/audit?userId=&action=&from=&to=` and `GET /api/admin/audit/csv`.
- Staff (`admin` / `officer`) opening another user’s DPR logs `admin_view`.

Rows still store time, userId, role, action, optional targetType/targetId, IP. **Not** Aadhaar, **not** DPR text.

---

## 4.7 Stage 3 — private KYC and 12-month purge

### Files

- Step 18 / identity uploads go to `uploads/kyc/` as `KycFile` rows. They are **not** sent to public Cloudinary. `/uploads/kyc` and `/uploads/documents` are **not** served as static files.
- Mongo stores `{ status: "uploaded", fileId, originalName }` — not a public URL. Aadhaar/PAN **numbers** typed into those keys are dropped on save.
- The DPR preview/PDF shows **Uploaded** or **Pending**. It does not embed the scan. Banks/DIC still need the original attachment from the applicant.
- Optional at-rest encryption: set `KYC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (any passphrase; hashed to AES-256-GCM). Without it, files stay local and private, just unencrypted on disk.

### Retention job

`runRetentionJob()` (`server/src/services/retention.service.ts`). Starts ~20s after boot, then every 6 hours. Admin: **Audit log → Run retention** or `POST /api/admin/retention/run`.

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `RETENTION_IDLE_DAYS` | 365 (12 months) | Delete after last **edit** (`DPRVersion.updatedAt`) |
| `RETENTION_WARNING_DAYS` | **15** | Warn this many days **before** that delete |
| `KYC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | unset | Encrypt KYC files if set |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` / `TWILIO_FROM` | unset | Real SMS. If any is missing, SMS is **mocked** (`[sms:mock]` in the server log) |

1. When a DPR has been idle for `idle − 15` days (350 on defaults): set `retentionWarningAt` **without** bumping `updatedAt`, log `retention_warning`, write an in-app `UserNotification`, mock-SMS the user’s `phoneNumber` (or `[sms:skip]` if none), mock-email (`[email:mock]`). Bell in the header + Privacy page.
2. After the 15-day warning **and** 12 months idle → delete that DPR, its cluster sections, KYC files, and the project **if** it has no other DPRs. **Never the user account.** Log `retention_purge`. Audit rows stay.

`NotifyService` (`server/src/services/notify.service.ts`) is the Twilio plug: REST `Messages.json` only when all three Twilio env vars are set. Do not add the Twilio SDK until those keys exist.

Submitted / approved copies use the **same** last-edit clock unless Stage 4 writes a longer hold.

## 6. How to test Stage 1

Run **client** (`npm run dev` in `client`, usually http://localhost:5173) and **server** (`npm run dev` in `server`, usually http://localhost:5000) with MongoDB and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as you already do.

Use a **new email** for each register test so you do not fight old users.

### A. Privacy page

1. Open http://localhost:5173/privacy (logged out).
2. Toggle English / Telugu — body language should change.
3. Confirm it names **MSME One Department**, mock mail `privacy.grievance@msmeone.gov.in`, 12-month drafts, optional AI, under-18 guardian line.

### B. Register — adult, AI off

1. `/register`. Fill name, email, password, **date of birth 18+**.
2. The account tick is greyed until you **scroll the notice box to the bottom**. Then tick account consent. Leave **AI** unticked.
3. Register stays clickable. If the notice is not scrolled/ticked, you get a toast and stay on the form. After notice + tick, submit → land on dashboard. No extra privacy popup (notice already accepted).
4. Open **Create New Latest DPR**, pick a scheme, fill unit name. **Generate all steps with AI** and **Get AI Suggestions** should be disabled / show the “AI will not work” warning.
5. Open **AI Assistant** (`/chat`), send a message → should fail with the AI-off message (toast).
6. You should still type fields, **Save draft**, and use the live preview.

### C. Register — adult, AI on

1. New email, DOB 18+, tick account **and** AI.
2. Latest DPR → Fill with AI / suggestions should run (needs a valid OpenAI key).
3. Chat should answer.

### D. Register — under 18

1. DOB that makes the person 16 (or any date &lt; 18 years ago). The yellow guardian box appears under date of birth.
2. Click **Register** (even if you are at the bottom of the form). The page **scrolls to the yellow warning**. No account is created.
3. Login with that email must fail (user was not created).

### E. Old user (re-consent)

1. Log in as an account created **before** Stage 1 (no `privacy.noticeVersion` in Mongo), **or** in Mongo set `privacy.noticeVersion` to `"old"`.
2. Dashboard should be blocked by **“Please review how we use your data”**.
3. You cannot tick agree until you **scroll the notice to the bottom**. Then tick account consent and **Agree and continue**.
4. Logout from the modal works without accepting.

Demo **Quick Test Login** (`jaa@gmail.com`) will hit this popup until that user accepts once.

### F. Latest DPR — promoter age under 18

1. Logged in as 18+ with any AI setting.
2. Open a scheme pack that has **Entrepreneur age**. Type `16`.
3. Guardian banner. **Save draft** and generate / fill-all should refuse.
4. Change age to `32` → save should work.

### G. Scheme Finder

1. `/venture-match`. On the **age** question, guardian box is visible.
2. Choose **Below 18 years**, finish the quiz.
3. Matches may be empty / loan schemes failed. **Create DPR** / **Generate DPR for this Match** must **not** appear.
4. Start again, choose 21–50, those buttons return.

### H. Audit (Mongo)

In the same DB the API uses:

```js
db.auditevents.find().sort({ at: -1 }).limit(20)
```

Expect `register`, `notice_accepted`, `consent_given` after a new signup; `login_success` / `login_failed`; `logout`; `ai_call` after a successful AI request (not when AI is refused). Rows must not contain Aadhaar numbers or DPR body text.

### I. JWT (production guard)

Do **not** point a production deploy at this app without `JWT_SECRET` set to a long random value. With `NODE_ENV=production` and no/weak secret, the server process should exit at startup.

---

## 7. How to test Stage 2

Use an **adult** account that already passed Stage 1 consent. Keep a **second** dummy account if you want to test admin delete.

### A. Privacy settings

1. Log in. Click **Privacy** in the header, or Profile → **Open privacy settings**. URL: `/account/privacy`.
2. **Download my data** — a JSON file should download. Open it: name/email/projects/DPRs present, **no** `passwordHash`.
3. Untick **Allow AI help** and wait for the saved toast. Open Latest DPR: Fill with AI should be off. Tick it again to restore.
4. Fill **Nominee** name + phone or email → Save. Reload the page; nominee is still there.
5. **Recent activity** should list login, export, consent change, nominee.

### B. Complaint

1. On the same page, send a short subject and message.
2. Toast says it was saved. In Mongo: `db.privacycomplaints.find().sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(5)` — inbox is the mock mail.
3. Activity shows `complaint_submitted` (or “Privacy request sent”).

### C. Delete my account

1. Use a **throwaway** account with at least one saved draft (and an upload if you can).
2. Type `DELETE` (all caps) and click **Delete my account**. You should land on the public home page and cannot log in with that email.
3. Mongo: user / projects / dprversions for that id gone. `db.auditevents.find({ action: 'account_delete' })` still has a row. Cloudinary/local files for that draft should be gone if they existed.

### D. Admin audit

1. Log in as **admin** (`authorize('admin')` on the API; UI tab is Super Admin).
2. Admin Dashboard → **Audit log**. Filter by action `login_success` or the throwaway user’s id.
3. **CSV** downloads `audit-log.csv` with at, userId, role, action, target, IP.
4. Admin **delete user** on another dummy should cascade like C (not only the user row).

### E. Officer view

If an admin/officer opens another user’s DPR by id, expect `admin_view` in the audit list. Own DPR views are not logged as admin_view.

---

## 8. How to test Stage 3

Old users will see the re-consent popup because the notice is now **`2026-09-3`**. Accept it, then:

### A. Private upload

1. Latest DPR → uploads step. Upload a dummy PDF as Aadhaar/PAN.
2. Form shows **Uploaded** and the original filename, not a `https://res.cloudinary.com/…` link.
3. Save draft. In Mongo the field should look like `{ status: "uploaded", fileId, originalName }` — no public URL.
4. Open `http://localhost:5000/uploads/kyc/<filename>` in a logged-out browser — **404**.
5. Preview/download the DPR: identity section is Uploaded / Pending, scan is not in the PDF.

### B. No Aadhaar number field

If a payload still sends `aadhaar: "1234 5678 9012"`, after save that value should be empty. The file status can remain.

### C. Retention (short clock)

1. Put a **phone number** on Profile (so SMS is mocked, not skipped).
2. In the **server** `.env` set `RETENTION_IDLE_DAYS=0` and `RETENTION_WARNING_DAYS=0`. Restart the server.
3. Have a saved draft. As admin, **Run retention** (or wait ~20s after boot).
4. First run: `retention_warning`, Mongo `retentionWarningAt` on the DPR, header bell + Privacy → Notifications, server log `[sms:mock]` and `[email:mock]`. Account still logs in.
5. Run again: that DPR (and its project if it was the only one) is gone. User can still log in. Audit has `retention_purge`.
6. Remove the test env vars so production stays **365 + 15 days**. Leave Twilio env unset until a real SID/token/from exist.

Optional: `KYC_ENCRYPTION_KEY=any-long-secret` then upload again; `uploads/kyc` bytes should not be a readable PDF (`KYC1` prefix).

---

## 9. What Stages 1–3 do not do

- Real grievance inbox, gazette legal name, OpenAI/Cloudinary contracts, breach playbook (Stage 4)
- A chatbot that “closes” a complaint — a person must reply
- A legal statement of DPDP compliance

---

## 10. What we may say after Stage 3

We may say: we do not keep identity scans as public links; old unused drafts are cleaned up after a warning; users can still take and delete their data.

We must **not** say: legal compliance is complete. We must **not** say we comply with DPDP.
